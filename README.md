# Fractal fun
Random fractal doodles I make during class.

Do not expect good or efficient code :^)

## Currently available fractals:
- Some kind of zig-zag thing
- Sierpinski triangle
- Barnsley fern

## TODO
- [ ] Unify the fractals into a single application, preferably with menu (egui?) + zoom support. Fractal traits?
- [ ] Mandelbrot set
- [ ] Julia set
- [ ] Newton's Fractal (3B1B <3)
